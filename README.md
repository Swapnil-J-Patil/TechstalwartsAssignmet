ProfileHub is a mobile application designed to provide a seamless user experience with three main functionalities.
The login screen enables users to enter their username and password to log in, using the https://reqres.in/api/login API.
  Once logged in, users are taken to the home screen, which displays a list of users with their pictures, names, and emails fetched from https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2. 
 This screen also includes a search bar to filter users, a button to show the current location, and an option to log out. The current location screen shows the user's GPS location.</B>
